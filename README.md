# WWU-Class-Site

This project was my version of the website classopen.wallawalla.edu 

# About 
In this project I used **dart** for the langauge and **flutter** for the UI. 

# How to run
If ran, make sure to be in a flutter workspace. The file to run is in the **lib** folder and is called **main_.dart.** It is preferable to display on a chrome web browswer when ran. The project is still ongoing but is perfectly useable right now.
